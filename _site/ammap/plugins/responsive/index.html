    <h1 id="amcharts-responsive">amCharts Responsive</h1>

<p>Version: 1.0.5</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Use this plugin to enable “responsive” features for amCharts’ JavaScript Charts,
JavaScript Stock Chart, or JavaScript Maps.</p>

<p>“Responsive” chart or map will modify it’s features dynamically (even as you
resize the container) based on the available area. For example: a full fledged 
line chart with legend guides, labels, titles and other elements will be 
displayed in all its glory if container is big enough.</p>

<p>If the container shrinks (i.e. you resize a browser window or view it on an
iPad), it starts “compacting” the chart. First the legend is removed. Shrink it
even further, axis titles are removed and its value labels are moved inside the
plot area. Going even smaller, bullets, labels gone. All the way to the
sparkline representation of the chart.</p>

<p>Plugin brings a universal set of pre-defined rules that you can use to instantly
enable responsiveness. Those are custom-tailored for each chart/map type and
will probably fit your requirements out-of the-box. All you need to do is to
enable “responsive” plugin for your chart instance.</p>

<p>You can modify those defaults rules, or make your own list. The plugin allows
that. (see further down this file for instructions)</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Include the minified version of file of this plugin. I.e.:</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;script src="amcharts/plugins/responsive/responsive.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(this needs to go after all the other amCharts includes)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the following setting to your chart configuration:</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>AmCharts.makeChart( "chartdiv", {
  ...,
  "responsive": {
    "enabled": true
  }
} );
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if you are using non-JSON setup:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>chart.responsive = {
  "enabled": true
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-use">Advanced use</h2>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<p>You can modify (or completely overwrite) the default responsive rules used by
the plugin.</p>

<p>A plugin works by checking chart area dimensions after each resize. (or after
initial build / mobile device orientation change) It then overrides particular
settings suitable for these particular dimensions.</p>

<p>Override rules are implemented by defining chart rules, or just “rules” moving
forward. Each rule has two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dimension conditions;</li>
  <li>Overrides. (a set of properties to override for this particular rule)</li>
</ol>

<p>A rule is an object, for example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "minWidth": 200,
  "maxWidth": 400,
  "maxHeight": 400,
  "minHeight": 200,
  "overrides": {
    "precision": 2,
    "legend": {
      "enabled": false
    },
    "valueAxes": {
      "inside": true
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above rule will be applicable to a chart that is between 200px and 400px in
width and height.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to add all of the dimensional properties. You just neat at
least one.</p>

<p>So for example to make the rule apply to all charts with width 400px or lower,
you would do something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "maxWidth": 400,
  "overrides": {
    "precision": 2,
    "legend": {
      "enabled": false
    },
    "valueAxes": {
      "inside": true
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Please note that there are several other conditional properties besides the ones
that deal with chart’s dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“rotate” (true|false) - set this property if you want to make this rule
applicable to rotated serial chart only (i.e. bar chart)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“legendPosition” (“top|bottom|left|right”) - set this property if you want the
rule applied only when the chart legend is set to particular position.
Please note that this does not check whether the legend is enabled at all.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, on to explaining “overrides”. It’s an object, that contains properties that
you want to override the chart’s initial ones with.</p>

<p>It can be either simple properties, like “fontSize” or “precision”, or complext
types like object, or array.</p>

<p>To override a property of a child object, such as “legend”, you would simply go
with JSON representation of the properties you need to override. I.e.:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"legend": {
  "enabled": false
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will look for a “legend” property in chart object, then change it’s
“enabled” property to false.</p>

<h3 id="overriding-arrays-of-objects">Overriding arrays of objects</h3>

<p>Some objects in charts are collected in arrays, i.e. “graphs”, “valueAxes”, etc.</p>

<p>There are some ways to override their properties as well.</p>

<p>To override properties for ALL objects in the array, you would provide an
override instruction as an object. I.e.:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"graphs": {
  "bullet": "round",
  "lineThickness": 5
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above will add a round bullet and set line thickness to all of the graphs on
the chart.</p>

<p>You can also target individual items in the array. There are two ways to do
that:</p>

<p>a) Use “id” property;
b) Apply using the same index.</p>

<p>To individually apply property overrides, you will need to supply override
instructions as an array:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"graphs": [
  {
    "id": "g1",
    "bullet": "round",
    "lineThickness": 5
  }
]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above will apply the same properties for the graph with an id of “g1” only.
It will not touch the rest of the graphs.</p>

<p>Please note that original graph definition in your chart settings needs to have
the “id” property set so this plugin can target it.</p>

<p>Or you can omit the “id” and just apply overrides in the same order as you have
them defined. I.e.:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"graphs": [
  {
    "bullet": "round"
  },
  {
    "bullet": "square"
  }
]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above will apply round bullets to the first defined graph, and square
bullets to the second graph.</p>

<h3 id="chaining-multiple-rules">Chaining multiple rules</h3>

<p>The cool pat is that you can daisy-chain the override rules, much like in CSS.</p>

<p>The plugin will examine all of the rules if their dimensional conditions match
current chart condition and will apply their overrides in the same order they
are defined.</p>

<p>Consider this rule set:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"responsive": {
  "enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    // at 400px wide, we hide legend
    {
      "maxWidth": 400,
      "overrides": {
        "legend": {
          "enabled"
        }
      }
    },

    // at 300px or less, we move value axis labels inside plot area
    // the legend is still hidden because the above rule is still applicable
    {
      "maxWidth": 300,
      "overrides": {
        "valueAxes": {
          "inside": true
        }
      }
    },

    // at 200 px we hide value axis labels altogether
    {
      "maxWidth": 200,
      "overrides": {
        "valueAxes": {
          "labelsEnabled": false
        }
      }
    }

  ]
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In case several rules modify the same property, the last one will always “win”.</p>

<h3 id="combining-custom-rules-with-pre-defined-ones">Combining custom rules with pre-defined ones</h3>

<p>The plugin will combine your custom rules with pre-defined ones automatically.</p>

<p>In case you want to go pure and set only your own responsive rules, you can set
property “addDefaultRules” to false. I.e.:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"responsive": {
  "enabled": true,
  "addDefaultRules": false,
  "rules": [
    {
      "maxWidth": 400,
      "overrides": {
        "legend": {
          "enabled"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When your custom rules are combined with pre-defined ones, yours are appended at
the end of the list. This means that your rules will always have the “last
word”.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>This plugin requires at least 3.13 version of JavaScript Charts, JavaScript
Stock Chart or JavaScript Maps.</p>

<p>Any older versions will be ignored by this plugin. The charts will function but
no responsive rules will be applied to them.</p>

<h2 id="demos">Demos</h2>

<p>Run the index.html in the subdirectory /examples. It will allow viewing misc
chart types at various resolutions.</p>
