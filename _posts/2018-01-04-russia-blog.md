>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well in all fairness Saint Petersburg was definitely the less depressing place I have ever visited. I almost forgot about my depression. I was attending the TEFL course which is supposed to prepare you how to teach people English (like anything can prepare you for that horror). But it was nice how I totally dominated over native speakers on that course while they were like ‘grammar, what is that?’ 

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another great thing is that I had the best host ever! Her name was poetic, Ema Fyedorovna, like a real melancholic lady from one of the Dostoyevsky’s novels. She was in her 70’s, and the best part was she was not married nor had any children and she couldn’t care less about it. She was also unfortunately ill, she told me her back hurts really bad so she was on pain medication. The more her back hurt the happier she was, I thought this was strange until I found a bottle of Valium on the kitchen table. Best friend I have ever met during my travels. Dear Ema, I miss you and I’m sorry we are not writing letters to each other anymore. When people ask me how I see myself in the future, I lie of course but this is exactly how I picture myself: living in a century old stylish apartment is Saint Petersburg enjoying happy pills and hosting exchange students. We did not have a common language, but boy did we understand each other. 

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, the first group of images are showing the luxury of Saint Petersburg. The question is where did it come from? Many stories about the history of Saint Petersburg are full of trumpeting and achievement while others (Including the ones from Dostoevsky and Pushkin) are telling the stories of thousands of convicts and prisoners of wars that gave their lives to erect the city on a swampy ground where snow is present from September till May. As a result, Saint Petersburg is also known as the ‘city built on bones’.

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are examples of extravagant lifestyles of the Russian richest families, high society with all the concert and dinner halls, but alongside the nobles’ places, lets face it, we all know that the working classes laboured in poverty and I honestly can’t understand how is it possible that this side of story is so rarely told to the tourists enjoying the beauties of the scenery. I felt personally insulted by looking at it. 

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an evidence of a low-income apartments behind the street view flats, some parts are made as a huge standardise blocks of identical flats for around 10,000 people or more, something we call ‘social infrastructure’ in Serbia. 
For tourist that visit Saint Petersburg it is breath-taking, fairy-tale like city, but leaving the city would probably made them consider their first impression. 

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I ate really well – there is cabbage and beetroot in everything, sour cream is a must, but all the others from my group got some kind of stomach flu so it made my plans to dominate on the course easier. 

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of pictures are at my favourite place – cemetery. The weather was cloudy, heavy and cold – a perfect day for a visit.
