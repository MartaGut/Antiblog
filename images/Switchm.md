image_name: Playing Switch
text: The name of this game is 'Switch', it is a bit similar to 'Music chairs'. Children would stand in two lines next to chairs and read the flashcards I am showing them. When I say 'Swich' they would run to the opposite line and sit on a chair. Of course there was always one chair missing and a kid without it would leave the game.
